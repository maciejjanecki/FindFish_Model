Configure Modes NOT scientifically validated, documented, supported or even advised to be used:

   C13 		(-c13)
       The C13 mode for bgc=cn is NOT scientifically validated or documented and NOT recommended to be used.

   CASA 	(-bgc casa)
       The bgc=casa mode is NOT scientifically validated or documented and NOT recommended to be used.

   BUILDPIO  	(-pio)
       This mode is NOT tested and not even functional and hence should NOT be used. PIO WILL be provided
       in future versions however.

   SNICAR_FRC 	(-snicar_frc)
       This mode is tested and functional, but is NOT constantly scientifcally validated, and should be 
       considered experimental.

   PERGRO 	(-pergro)
       This mode is tested to be functional, but NOT scientifically validated. It's purpose is in an attempt
       to validate that a port to a new machine is reasonable, or changes that are only roundoff will NOT 
       affect the climate. The best method for this validation is to run 100 year simulations with both and
       make sure the climate is similar between each. We hope to validate the method using PERGRO in future
       versions of the model.

build-namelist items that are NOT recommended:

-lnd_res 

This is the option to turn on the fine-mesh mode of CLM, running CLM at a finer
resolution than the atmospheric forcing. This is an experimental mode and NOT recommend
for general use. You turn this on by 

Namelist items that should NOT be exercised:

  create_crop_landunit:  Functional, but experimental
  carbon_only:           (carbon_only=.true. with -bgc cn)
                         The Carbon only mode of CN model is known to be too productive, and requires some modifications 
                         that will be on an update to the CESM1.0 release.
  urban_traffic:         Not currently functional
  pio namelist options:  hist_pioflag, ncd_lowmem2d, ncd_pio_def, ncd_pio_UseRearranger, ncd_pio_UseBoxRearr, 
                         ncd_pio_SerialCDF, ncd_pio_DebugLevel, and ncd_pio_num_iotasks
        These options are NOT currently tested or functional. See the pio configure mode above.
  fine-mesh namelist options: 
  casa namelist options: lnpp, lalloc, q10, spunup, and fcpool

        As above CASA is NOT scientifically validated and hence we don't recommend using it, thus we don't
        recommend using the casa namelist options (they are only available when running with CASA).
