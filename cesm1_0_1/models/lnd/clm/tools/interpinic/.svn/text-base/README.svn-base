Tool to interpolate initial datasets to a different resolution or
mask.


Running gnumake in this directory will create an executable named

   "interpinic"  

Its function is to map an input clm initial file to an output clm initial file,
where the output clm initial file is overwritten with the interpolated values.

NOTE: In order to successfully build, some source files are required from
      other clm src directories. See the Filepath for the expected path of
      required files.

USAGE:

interpinic -i <input initial data file>  -o <output initial data file>

Options to gmake:

make OPT=TRUE     # will compile with production compiler options on
make SMP=TRUE     # will compile with Open-MP parallelism on
